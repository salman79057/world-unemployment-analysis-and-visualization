The problem has aggravated in the recent times with the economic slowdown taking jobs of numerous people and drying up new opportunities for them with regular news of companies focussing on restructring their organization and countless layoff's as a consequence. If this problem is not dealt with, with firm hand and a proper direction then our youths will be having hardships thus impacting their future.\n\nThis little analysis takes a first look at the unemployment data collated by World bank from around the world and collected over a 5 year period from 2010 to 2014. The data includes individual nations as well as nations grouped according to income level and supranational groups such as Arab World, EU etc. A lot more manipulations could be done on the data for a lot in-depth analysis.\n\n**P.S.:This is my first hand at general analysis using Python other than the specialized scientific data (Pressure, Temperature, Velocity, Turbulence etc. data using MATLAB etc.) that I am used too so any long lines of codes or any thing that can be done in short cuts should please be forgiven. A lot of work in here is inspired from the works of Anisotropic (https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/d/sovannt/world-bank-youth-unemployment/generation-unemployed-interactive-plotly-visuals) and whose beautifully done analysis is an inspiration for this work.

Looking into column names gives an idea of what might be contained in the data and a look into the countries here will help us determine if any countries are repeated. Since only 219 rows are there a manual check of each row is possible in this case. Also we have to check whether all the data is only for individual nations or also from Supranational organizations (like UN, EU, SAARC, G8, G20 to name a few) or from banking institutions (IBD,ADB,IMF,income categorization etc.). This will help us in the analysis as it won't make sense to compare countries with organization groups (this is akin to apple vs oranges). A detailed analysis will look into the data vis-a-vis at the level of individual countries and as part of an organization. A certain extent of the success of these organizations can be judged from the unemployment statistics as to how successful these organizations in living up to the aspirations of the youth, in negotiating with each other for providing job opportunities to the young population of the group members. Though it will only provide one facet or one metric of success/failure of an organization yet it will bring into fore the effects of these organizations.\n \nThe process that will be followed in this project is to first divide the original datasets into a number of constituent smaller datasets each catering to one group viz. Individual Counteries, Supranational Groups and finally the income groups. Then we can have a peek on how unemployment has affected the world around us and which regions/counteries are most and least afflicted by it \nand which have been most and least successful in tiding over the unemployment crisis.

For our analysis purposes we will segregate the original dataset acording to the type of enteries i.e. Country, Supranational and Income Groups.

from Graphs**\n\nAlthough the net change in unemployment rates over 2 year periods (2010-'12 & 2012-'14) has been plotted for all countries, I am mainly going to keep this discussion focussed on the long term change (2010-'14) and that to on countries which are either most successful or an utter failure in dealing with rising unemployment rates. These long term rates is basically a mirror to the willingness/unwillingness of the particular country's govt. to achieve sustainable growth in employment opportunities to counter the rising unemployment. \n\n> **Top Successful Countries**\n\n> The horizontal bar plot on the left hand side shows the top 15 countries which were most successful in dealing with unemployment in their countries over the period of 2010-14. As can be seen most of these countries are in europe with estonia being the most successful in dealing with unemployment having a negative growth rate of -16.29 % although it's unemployment rate still stood at 17 % which is still higher than most other countries. the top 5 countries are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova and Ghana. A special mention to the unemployment rate in USA which is able to achieve a reduction of about 5 % in it's unemployment rate from 2010-14.  \n\n\n> **Least Successful Countries**\n\n> Here again the list of least successful countries is dominated by european countries with countries like Greece, Spain and Italy reeling under high rates of unemployment among it's people. Most of these european countries have seen a double digit increase in their unemployment rates with situations reaching critical proportions in countries like greece with an unemployment rate of ~54 % in 2014 and spain suffering under a 57 % unemployment rate. All the countries in this list present a state of gloomy future for their youths with the respective authorities unable to rein in the unemployment monster. \n\nNote: A higher value in the top 15 successful and bottom 15 failures in no way suggest that there are aren't other countries where unemployment isn't as dangerous as in these countries. Take for example South africa which was already having an unemployment rate of 50.8 % in 2010 which jumped to 52.6 % in 2014, making their 5 year change a lowly ~3 %, as compared to 22 % increase for greece taking it to 53.9 %. What this bar plots indicate are the countries most capable/ill-equipped to deal with unemployment."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"15d6862799334416d59d46eb9df775250c74587d","_cell_guid":"664fca79-552c-cccf-3284-e3caece8b5a2"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Visualization on Maps\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words (not sure it was exactly this) cannot be more apt when you can associate the names of places with their location on a map.

Asia with two of the world's biggest developing economies i.e. India and China seem to be doing something right and has kept the unemployment rate on the lower side. Russian Federation and United States have some good news as they have witnessed a reduction in the unemployment rates.
